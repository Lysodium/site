Hi ðŸ‘‹! I am currently a senior at Columbia University majoring in Mathematics and Data Science. This website is a work in progress. 

I have also started photography recently (specifically film), so expect a bunch of photos spread across this site until I create a collection.



You can also find my resume [here](https://leonzhou.xyz/resume/Resume.pdf).


Feel free to send me an email at [Leon.zhou@columbia.edu](mailto:leon.zhou@columbia.edu) anytime.
